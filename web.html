        command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
        Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education

      <p id="P2">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or prabhu.[28] The education was
        delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was very important part of the
        education.[29] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in
        India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not
        in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
        there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast
        to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.</p>

      <p id="P2">Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State Governments at national and state
        levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness,
        science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian
        secondary school system.[54] A significant feature of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on
        inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society.[citation needed] Professionals from established
        institutes are often called to support in vocational training.Another feature of India's secondary school system
        is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of
        his/her choosing.[55] A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form
        of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.[56] Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) which is the most
        recent initiative of Government of India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary education (USE).
        It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of secondary education up to class X.[57] </p>
